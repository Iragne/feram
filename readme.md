# Feram

The **F**ork, **e**dit, **r**equest **a**nd **m**erge Bot.
(Feram also means wild in latin)

Feram automatically crawls GitHub repositories,
checks for various possible problems and finally makes
pull requests to fix them.


## Roadmap

Feram currently gets a major overhaul.
As soon as the next stable version is ready
we will update this repo accordingly.
